# How-To-Create-a-Repository
Here in this repo I have created a new repository to demonstrate how to create repo, add file in it, make changes in file, add child branch to the master branch pull the changes in file and then merge it to the main master branch

## Objectives

* Create a branch
* Commit changes in the child branch
* Open a pull request (PR)
* Merge the PR into the master branch
